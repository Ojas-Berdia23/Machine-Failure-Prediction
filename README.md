# 📌Machine-Failure-Prediction

This project applies machine learning techniques to predict industrial machine failures based on historical sensor data. By analyzing over 10,000 data points, it helps optimize maintenance schedules, reduce downtime, and improve efficiency.

## 🚀 Features
- 📊 **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming raw data for model training.
- 🔍 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends and insights.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models**: Implementing predictive models for failure detection.
- 🎯 **Performance Evaluation**: Analyzing model accuracy and optimizing predictions.
- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Graphical insights into machine health and failure patterns.

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Python** 🐍  
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualization  
- **Scikit-learn**, **TensorFlow/Keras** (if deep learning is used)  

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains machine sensor readings and failure labels. Key features include:  
- **Temperature, Pressure, Vibration Levels**  
- **Operating Hours, Load Conditions**  
- **Failure Events (Labels)**
